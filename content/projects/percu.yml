about: This website was made for a small organisation based in Nantes (France). They provide african dance and drum lessons and needed a way to display posters for upcoming activities, handle new members and application forms, and show images taken during their various activities. They already had a website but it was in need of a redesign to make it easier for new members to navigate.
