# == Project descriptions =========================================================================

descent-desc: &descent-desc
  A website created for a video-game community to showcase the fan-art made and to describe the lore of the game.

percu-desc: &percu-desc
  The landing page for a music association where they can post media and inform people of upcoming events.

sfinder-desc: &sfinder-desc
  This app was made in an attempt to locate some tags around Nantes during my university years.
  It groups all the known tags in a database with accompanying text found alongside them.<br><br>
  <i>The database server is currently offline, so the app doesn't work</i>

boundary-desc: &boundary-desc
  I developped this app during the Covid-19 lockdowns as a means to learn learn android development.
  It's a small prototype made to show the area on a map where one can venture with regards to the distance restrictions.

arrow-desc: &arrow-desc
  Instead of pointing towards north, this SUPER COMPASS (TM) points towards a selected location,
  just as it would in a video-game quest<br><br>
  <i>I'm not too sure why but the app is currently broken ...</i>

mangatech-desc: &manga-desc
  After borrowing a monstrous amount of manga from friends, I needed to keep tabs on what's been borrowed and who it belongs to.
  So instead of opening a google note like a normal person, I decided to spend 2 months developping this little gem.
  It ain't completely finished yet so there might be updates in the future.
